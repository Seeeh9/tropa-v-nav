"""Takes voice clips downloaded from Google AI Studio into the game and checks them by ear.

    python tools/voice_in.py <ru-old|ru|en> <text key> [...]   # -> assets/voice/<lang>/<key>.wav
    python tools/voice_in.py --named                          # every tropa__<lang>__<key>.wav waiting

A clip the page helper saved under its own name (`tropa__<lang>__<key>.wav`) says which line it
is, so clips from several tabs at once can be taken in whatever order they arrived.

AI Studio saves every clip as `Generated Audio <date>.wav`; the waiting ones are taken in the
order they arrived, one per key. Each clip is then heard by a local Whisper (tools/hear.py) and
scored against the line it should say, taken from assets/i18n/<lang>/*.ftl: a clip that was
saved before the model finished, or that dropped words, shows as a low score and is left in
Downloads under `REJECTED <key>.wav` instead of going into the game. A good clip is levelled on the
way in (see `level`), because the model's voice sinks towards the end of a page; loudness by fifths
of the clip is printed before and after.
